# Sales Dashboard Project

🚀 **Excited to share my latest project: Sales Dashboard Requirements completed using Tableau!** <br>

This project focused on providing actionable insights into sales metrics and trends by designing a comprehensive dashboard. Here's what I achieved: <br>

✨ **KPI Overview**: Summarized total sales, profits, and quantities for the current and previous year with visual elements like sparklines and bar-in-bar charts. <br>
🔢 **Sales Trends**: Analyzed monthly KPI data, highlighting months with the highest and lowest sales using intuitive visual cues. <br>
🔍 **Product Subcategory Comparison**: Compared sales performance across product subcategories with a focus on sales and profit relationships. <br>
🕐 **Weekly Trends**: Presented weekly sales and profit data, calculated averages, and highlighted weeks above or below the average to emphasize performance trends. <br>

This experience helped me deepen my understanding of data visualization and sharpen my analytical skills while leveraging the power of Tableau to turn raw data into meaningful insights. <br>

🙏 **Gratitude** <br>
Grateful for the opportunity to work on this project and enhance my data storytelling capabilities. Looking forward to applying these skills to future challenges! <br>
